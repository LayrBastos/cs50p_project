# Who's that Pokémon?! -  Guessing Game
CS50p Final Project for obtainment of Harvard's CS50p Certificate.

## How the game works:
This is a guessing game in which the player must discover who is the misterious Pokémon based on the given hints.
After making a guess, the hidden Pokémon will compare it's height and weight with the guessed Pokémon.
If the guessed Pokémon and the hidden one share the same Pokémon type, this information will be a hint given. The same applies to the case when both Pokémons have the same main colour.
